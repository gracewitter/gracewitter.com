        <h4>You have a vision for your business. You’re passionate about it. You can see every detail of your brand’s design in your head</h4>
        <h4>The problem is you can’t communicate your vision to anyone else.</h4>
        <div class="content-long">
            Maybe you tried working with designers in the past and couldn’t see eye to eye on the final result. Maybe you don’t trust your vision to anyone else and tried to DIY your website and are frustrated with the results.

            <strong>Don’t worry – Even just having a vision for your business can unleash extraordinary power.</strong>

            <strong>You just need help refining, communicating, and acting upon that vision</strong>

            We’ll work together to clearly define your brand personality – how exactly you want your business to look and feel. From there, every element of your design system, the colors, fonts, website, and logo will support that personality. At the end of this experience you can feel confident that every aspect of your brand matches your vision

            <span class="wwm-intro-text-accent">Let me help you translate your vision into a brand identity.</span>
